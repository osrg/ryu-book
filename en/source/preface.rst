Preface
========

This specialized book is for the Ryu development framework, which is used to achieve Software Defined Networking (SDN).

Why Ryu?

We hope you can find the answer in this book.

We recommend that you read Chapters 1 to 5, in that order. In Chapter 1, a simple switch hub is implemented, and in later chapters, traffic monitor and link aggregation functions are added. Through actual examples, we describe programming using Ryu.

Chapters 6 to 8 provide details about the OpenFlow protocol and the packet libraries that are necessary for programming using Ryu. In Chapters 9 to 11, we talk about how to use the firewall and test tool included in the Ryu package as sample applications. Chapters 12 to 14 introduce Ryu's architecture and introduction cases.

Finally, we would like to say thank you to those people, in particular users, who supported the Ryu project. We are waiting for your opinions via the mailing list.

Let's develop Ryu together!
